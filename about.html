    <p>Mariana, a spirited 27-year-old originally from Ukraine, embarked on a life-altering journey two years ago when she ventured to the USA. This pivotal move marked the beginning of a remarkable odyssey that has seen her traverse the realms of finance, entrepreneurship, and creative expression. </p>
